How long did you spend on the coding assignment? 2 hours for api documentation review, 6-8 hours for code


What would you add to your solution if you had more time? 

    1- I would write my CSS code in an organized way (for example use BEM - Block Element Modifier convention for classes and SASS/SCSS for styling - Also, would use separate css files and import partials files to the main css file).

    2- I prefer not to show all the results for spcific books at once. Instead, I would use a function to load limited number of books on search event, and the page would show additional results upon user scroll. Pagination could be used as well.


If you didn't spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

In my latest project, I used redux as a state management for my application which is mandatory for medium to large application. Here is my github repo for that: https://github.com/fjabbary/OMDB-Movie-React-Redux

How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this? In my personal projects, I used tools to compress my code as well as images to minimiized the size and loading time. In enterprise level, I haven't done it.

How would you improve the API that you just used? I found a some redundant data in this API that probably are not useful.
